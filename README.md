This is my first commit using HTML and CSS. It's my idea for a retro game/abandonware website where anyone can download the programs for free. This is my first long term commit that I'm making after completing freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design program. I'm sure the code can be vastly improved, but the goal is to make it as clean and optimized as possible with my current skill set.

It has a home page with featured games and articles, a page that lists some old abandonware games, a page that lists articles like reviews and tutorials on how to run older games on newer computers and finally an about page that explains why I wanted to make this certain website.
